        <h1>What is HCI?</h1>
        <p>HCI stands for Human-Computer Interaction. It is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on designing, evaluating, and implementing computer technology that is easy and efficient for people to use. HCI is concerned with the interaction between humans and computers, including the design and development of interactive technologies, tools, and systems for a wide range of applications, such as desktop and mobile applications, websites, and medical systems. The goal of HCI is to improve the user experience and make technology accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.</p>

        <h2>Definition of HCI</h2>
        <p>HCI refers to the communication between the human user and a computer system. It includes the design and development of application, such as desktop application, websites, and mobile apps, that are used in various domains such as healthcare, banking, education, and networking. HCI is also known as CHI (Computer Human Interface) or MMI (Man Machine Interaction). It is concerned with design, evaluation, and implementation, and is used to provide a user-friendly environment. The term HCI is often used to refer to the design and development of user interfaces, or the interaction between people and computers through input and output devices. HCI identifies the interaction between humans and systems, and includes language-based interaction and human motor skills. In HCI, the user interacts with a digital device, such as a computer or smartphone, to perform various activities. HCI aims to design systems that are efficient, stable, usable, and attainable. Lack of communication can result in poor designed user interfaces. HCI provides a way to reduce design time through various task models. HCI includes the design and development of application, and is used to create user-friendly environments.</p>
